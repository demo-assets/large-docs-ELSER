# large-docs-ELSER
This application will use to search through an index that contains large files where it will return the actual document and relevant chunks of the document. Keep in mind that the index must contain the original documents as well as the chunks generated upon ingest.


# Steps to run:
I recommend running everyting in a python virtual environment to avoid messing any system libraries:
- python3 -m venv myenv (for Mac M1) or python -m venv myenv
- source myenv/bin/activate
